    <h1>The Evolution of the Super Bowl: From Simple Championship to Global Spectacle (1966-2024)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Early Years: Birth of an Institution (1966-1975)</h2>
        <p>The first Super Bowl, then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, was played in 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Tickets averaged $12, and the game didn't even sell out. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in what would later be designated as Super Bowl I. The halftime show featured college marching bands, a far cry from today's extravaganzas.</p>
        <p>During these formative years, Super Bowl tickets remained relatively affordable, ranging from $12-$15, with simple entertainment featuring university bands and drill teams. The games were primarily hosted in warm-weather cities like Miami, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>By the late 1970s, the Super Bowl had evolved into America's premier sporting event. Ticket prices increased to $30-$75, reflecting growing demand. The 1980s saw the first signs of the modern Super Bowl entertainment experience, with performances by Up with People giving way to more mainstream artists.</p>
