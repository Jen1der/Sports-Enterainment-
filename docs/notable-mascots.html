      <h2>The Phillie Phanatic</h2>
      <h3>Baseball's Beloved Green Troublemaker (Est. 1978)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Famous for his ATV rides around Veterans Field</li>
        <li>Legendary dance routines atop the dugout</li>
        <li>Memorable feuds with Tommy Lasorda, including a 1988 incident where Lasorda attacked the Phanatic</li>
