# The Evolution of the Super Bowl: From Simple Championship to Global Spectacle (1966-2024)

## The Early Years: Birth of an Institution (1966-1975)
The first Super Bowl, then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, was played in 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Tickets averaged $12, and the game didn't even sell out. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in what would later be designated as Super Bowl I. The halftime show featured college marching bands, a far cry from today's extravaganzas.

During these formative years, Super Bowl tickets remained relatively affordable, ranging from $12-$15, with simple entertainment featuring university bands and drill teams. The games were primarily hosted in warm-weather cities like Miami, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.

## The Emerging Spectacle (1976-1990)
By the late 1970s, the Super Bowl had evolved into America's premier sporting event. Ticket prices increased to $30-$75, reflecting growing demand. The 1980s saw the first signs of the modern Super Bowl entertainment experience, with performances by Up with People giving way to more mainstream artists.

Notable developments:
- Super Bowl XX (1986): The first appearance of the iconic "Super Bowl Shuffle"
- Super Bowl XXIII (1989): First appearance by a major pop star during halftime (Elvis Presto)
- Television advertising rates crossed the $500,000 mark for 30-second spots

## The Modern Era Takes Shape (1991-2000)
The 1990s marked a revolutionary period for the Super Bowl halftime show. Michael Jackson's 1993 performance at Super Bowl XXVII transformed the event into must-see entertainment. Ticket prices now ranged from $150-$275, and corporate hospitality became a major focus.

Post-9/11, the Super Bowl became more than just a gameâ€”it emerged as a symbol of American unity and resilience. Production values soared, and ticket prices reflected this, ranging from $400 to over $1,000. The halftime show became increasingly elaborate, though not without controversy (Janet Jackson/Justin Timberlake, 2004).
